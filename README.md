# chill out VR 

sometimes de-stressing is a struggle. to help with that struggle, i try to maintain a state of mindfulness, though it often isn't easy to do that in situations where you feel anxious or frustrated. i made this project to serve as a calming influence and to help re-center myself when i'm feeling all over the place. i hope you can use this to your own needs too!

love,
em
